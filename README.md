# WaterSafe: A Water Network Benchmark for Fault Diagnosis Research

### Abstract

Currently, in the water distribution systems literature, fault detection methods are typically evaluated on benchmark water networks that do not include real-time experimental data, or on private commercial datasets, which prohibit the reproducibility of the results. Moreover, realistic modeling of faults on hydraulic system components, sensors and actuators is often unavailable. In this work, we provide a framework for the application of fault-diagnosis methodologies on WaterSafe, a water network benchmark for fault diagnosis. The WaterSafe benchmark is a small scale replica of a water transport network constructed using industrial components and devices, while the communications are implemented in a way that resemble a water utility's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system. A general problem formulation for fault-diagnosis on water systems is provided, in accordance to the mathematical model of the benchmark. Moreover, we provide a calibrated simulation model including system, sensor and actuator faults, based on observations from the real system. Finally, we provide open access to the datasets generated from the experiments containing the aforementioned faults.

### Data

All relevant data presented in the [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896322005870) are available in this repository. Researchers using the benchmark are encouraged to experimentally evaluate their solutions through the KIOS Water Systems Testbed.
